\
Pushed the changes, also FYI, will be updating some of the allocations to match the initial GTM\
\
Well actually just to clarify, the unlocks shown in the .md files for example in the https://github.com/Mbastidas001/SAIT/blob/main/sims/outputs_scenarios/base_mid/SAIT_Tokenomics_Report.md , are for 28% unlock of the allocations across 4 years (16q). I just misread the portion in my review. The allocations already match the initial GTM \
\
after review of them @Anthony Monroy the base_mid case is best so far, but still had 60 % overhang. So some  possible tweaks I am considering: smooth the early unlocks to reduce overhang <40%. , Exploring initial float +2\'963% for liquidity depth. , Increasing burn_share if early usage lags.\

# SAIT Tokenomics Simulation \'97 Plain English Context\
\
## What this is\
We modeled SAIT\'92s tokenomics to see how unlocks, burns, staking, and treasury cash interact.\
It shows whether SAIT stays scarce, whether the treasury runs out, and whether the design is credible.\
\
## Key assumptions in this run\
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 SAIT (fixed, no inflation).\
- **Initial circulation**: 10.0% of supply unlocked in Q1.\
- **Unlock cap**: \uc0\u8804  1.00% per month (\u8776  3.00% per quarter).\
- **Fee per action**: $0.25.\
- **Fee split**: 50% burn, 20% stakers, 30% treasury.\
- **Usage start**: 100,000 actions in Q1, growing 20.0% per quarter.\
- **Staking**: 25% of circulating tokens staked, with 12% APY cap.\
- **Treasury**: start $1,500,000, spending $600,000/quarter.\
- **Burn floor**: 2,000,000 SAIT per quarter, mode=treasury.\
- **Price path**: custom CSV (16 rows).\
\
## How to read the results\
- **Deflationary quarters**: times when burns exceed unlocks (circulating supply shrinks).\
- **Overhang vs Float**: supply waiting to unlock relative to what\'92s circulating (dump risk).\
- **Treasury runway**: quarters before treasury cash runs out.\
- **Crowdfund proceeds**: cash raised from planned sales (tiers).\
\
The following sections show KPI tables, per-scenario reports, and recommendations.\
\
# SAIT Tokenomics \'97 Consolidated Report\
\
## Executive Summary\
- This report compares total-supply scenarios using the same cap-compliant unlock schedule, fee/burn settings, and price path.\
- Burns scale with **usage** rather than supply, so SAIT burned is similar across caps; burn **percent** falls as supply grows.\
- Overhang/Float and Treasury runway are the two most important operational risk flags.\
\
## Inputs & Assumptions\
- Horizon: **16 quarters**\
- Total-supply grid: **1,000,000,000**\
- Initial float: **10.00%** of total (Q1 start)\
- Unlock cap: **1.00%/mo \uc0\u8658  3.00%/qtr** (global)\
- Usage: actions Q1=**100,000**, growth QoQ=**20.0%**\
- Fees: **$0.25/action** | Splits: burn=0.50, stakers=0.20, treasury=0.30\
- Staking: %staked=**25.0%** | target APY=**12.0%** (fee-funded cap)\
- Treasury: start=**$1,500,000**, ops=**$600,000/qtr**\
- Burn floor: **2,000,000 SAIT/q** (treasury)\
- Price: **custom CSV (16 rows)**\
\
## Schedule Diagnostics\
- Total unlock over 16q: **28.00%** of total supply\
- Avg unlock per quarter: **1.75%** | Max per quarter: **3.00%**\
- Global cap breaches: **none** (excess spilled forward if needed)\
\
### Unlocks by Bucket (16q totals)\
- Research: **11.60%**\
- Ecosystem: **8.80%**\
- Team: **2.10%**\
- Partners: **3.00%**\
- Treasury: **1.30%**\
- Liquidity: **1.20%**\
- Total: **28.00%**\
\
## Scenario Comparison (Key KPIs)\
| Total Supply | Init Float | Final Circ | Final Circ % | Cum Burn (SAIT) | Cum Burn % | Defl Qtrs | Runway Q (min) | Peak Unlock %/q | Max Overhang/Float | Avg Staker APY |\
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|\
| 1,000,000,000 | 100,000,000 | 347,999,998 | 34.80% | 32,000,000 | 3.20% | 3 | inf | 3.00% | 60.0% | 0.74% |\
\
## Recommendations\
- Reduce early unlocks (longer durations, stagger phases) or slightly increase initial float to bring Max Overhang/Float below 40%.\
- Publish the cap-compliant unlock curve and overhang metric alongside governance proposals to set expectations.\
- Add a burn floor (e.g., 2M SAIT/q) financed from treasury early on; remove when usage burns dominate.\
\
## Per-Scenario Details\
\
---\
\
### Scenario \'97 Total Supply 1,000,000,000\
\
\
## Headline\
- **Supply**: 16q unlocks = 28.00%; Final circ = 34.80% (347,999,998 SAIT).\
- **Burns**: cumulative = 32,000,000 SAIT (3.20%); Deflationary quarters: 3 (first: Q14).\
- **Treasury**: runway\uc0\u8776  inf q (min balance $3,400,000 at Q1).\
- **Overhang**: max = 60.00%; quarters > 40% = 2.\
\
## Unlocks by Bucket (16q total)\
- Research: 11.60%\
- Ecosystem: 8.80%\
- Team: 2.10%\
- Partners: 3.00%\
- Treasury: 1.30%\
- Liquidity: 1.20%\
- **Total**: 28.00%\
\
## Notes\
- Burns are driven by usage/fees/price, not by total supply \'97 hence identical SAIT burns across caps.\
- Global cap enforcer ensures per-quarter total unlock \uc0\u8804  3% (given 1%/mo cap).\
- Overhang is defined as next-2Q unlocks \'f7 starting float for the quarter.\
\
## Suggested levers if this scenario trips warnings\
- Reduce early unlock pace (longer durations / stagger phases) to cut overhang.\
- Raise burn_share / increase actions / fee_per_action / price to approach deflationary quarters.\
- Consider a small increase in initial float only if liquidity depth is a concern (trade-off: more potential sellers).\

- Overhang is defined as next-2Q unlocks \'f7 starting float for the quarter.\
\
## Suggested levers if this scenario trips warnings\
- Reduce early unlock pace (longer durations / stagger phases) to cut overhang.\
- Raise burn_share / increase actions / fee_per_action / price to approach deflationary quarters.\
- Consider a small increase in initial float only if liquidity depth is a concern (trade-off: more potential sellers).\

# SAIT Tokenomics Simulation \'97 Plain English Context\
\
## What this is\
We modeled SAIT\'92s tokenomics to see how unlocks, burns, staking, and treasury cash interact.\
It shows whether SAIT stays scarce, whether the treasury runs out, and whether the design is credible.\
\
## Key assumptions in this run\
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 SAIT (fixed, no inflation).\
- **Initial circulation**: 8.0% of supply unlocked in Q1.\
- **Unlock cap**: \uc0\u8804  1.00% per month (\u8776  3.00% per quarter).\
- **Fee per action**: $0.10.\
- **Fee split**: 60% burn, 15% stakers, 25% treasury.\
- **Usage start**: 100,000 actions in Q1, growing 20.0% per quarter.\
- **Staking**: 25% of circulating tokens staked, with 12% APY cap.\
- **Treasury**: start $1,500,000, spending $600,000/quarter.\
- **Burn floor**: 3,000,000 SAIT per quarter, mode=treasury.\
- **Price path**: custom CSV (16 rows).\
\
## How to read the results\
- **Deflationary quarters**: times when burns exceed unlocks (circulating supply shrinks).\
- **Overhang vs Float**: supply waiting to unlock relative to what\'92s circulating (dump risk).\
- **Treasury runway**: quarters before treasury cash runs out.\
- **Crowdfund proceeds**: cash raised from planned sales (tiers).\
\
The following sections show KPI tables, per-scenario reports, and recommendations.\
\
# SAIT Tokenomics \'97 Consolidated Report\
\
## Executive Summary\
- This report compares total-supply scenarios using the same cap-compliant unlock schedule, fee/burn settings, and price path.\
- Burns scale with **usage** rather than supply, so SAIT burned is similar across caps; burn **percent** falls as supply grows.\
- Overhang/Float and Treasury runway are the two most important operational risk flags.\
\
## Inputs & Assumptions\
- Horizon: **16 quarters**\
- Total-supply grid: **1,000,000,000, 500,000,000**\
- Initial float: **8.00%** of total (Q1 start)\
- Unlock cap: **1.00%/mo \uc0\u8658  3.00%/qtr** (global)\
- Usage: actions Q1=**100,000**, growth QoQ=**20.0%**\
- Fees: **$0.10/action** | Splits: burn=0.60, stakers=0.15, treasury=0.25\
- Staking: %staked=**25.0%** | target APY=**12.0%** (fee-funded cap)\
- Treasury: start=**$1,500,000**, ops=**$600,000/qtr**\
- Burn floor: **3,000,000 SAIT/q** (treasury)\
- Price: **custom CSV (16 rows)**\
\
## Schedule Diagnostics\
- Total unlock over 16q: **28.00%** of total supply\
- Avg unlock per quarter: **1.75%** | Max per quarter: **3.00%**\
- Global cap breaches: **none** (excess spilled forward if needed)\
\
### Unlocks by Bucket (16q totals)\
- Research: **11.60%**\
- Ecosystem: **8.80%**\
- Team: **2.10%**\
- Partners: **3.00%**\
- Treasury: **1.30%**\
- Liquidity: **1.20%**\
- Total: **28.00%**\
\
## Scenario Comparison (Key KPIs)\
| Total Supply | Init Float | Final Circ | Final Circ % | Cum Burn (SAIT) | Cum Burn % | Defl Qtrs | Runway Q (min) | Peak Unlock %/q | Max Overhang/Float | Avg Staker APY |\
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|\
| 1,000,000,000 | 80,000,000 | 311,999,998 | 31.20% | 48,000,000 | 4.80% | 3 | inf | 3.00% | 75.0% | 0.25% |\
| 500,000,000 | 40,000,000 | 132,000,000 | 26.40% | 48,000,000 | 9.60% | 3 | inf | 3.00% | 75.0% | 0.55% |\
\
## Recommendations\
- Reduce early unlocks (longer durations, stagger phases) or slightly increase initial float to bring Max Overhang/Float below 40%.\
- Publish the cap-compliant unlock curve and overhang metric alongside governance proposals to set expectations.\
- Add a burn floor (e.g., 2M SAIT/q) financed from treasury early on; remove when usage burns dominate.\

# SAIT Scenario \'97 Total Supply 1,000,000,000\
\
## Headline\
- **Supply**: 16q unlocks = 28.00%; Final circ = 31.20% (311,999,998 SAIT).\
- **Burns**: cumulative = 48,000,000 SAIT (4.80%); Deflationary quarters: 3 (first: Q14).\
- **Treasury**: runway\uc0\u8776  inf q (min balance $3,400,000 at Q1).\
- **Overhang**: max = 75.00%; quarters > 40% = 2.\

- **Total**: 28.00%\
\
## Notes\
- Burns are driven by usage/fees/price, not by total supply \'97 hence identical SAIT burns across caps.\
- Global cap enforcer ensures per-quarter total unlock \uc0\u8804  3% (given 1%/mo cap).\
- Overhang is defined as next-2Q unlocks \'f7 starting float for the quarter.\
\
## Suggested levers if this scenario trips warnings\
- Reduce early unlock pace (longer durations / stagger phases) to cut overhang.\
- Raise burn_share / increase actions / fee_per_action / price to approach deflationary quarters.\
- Consider a small increase in initial float only if liquidity depth is a concern (trade-off: more potential sellers).\

# SAIT Tokenomics Simulation \'97 Plain English Context\
\
## What this is\
We modeled SAIT\'92s tokenomics to see how unlocks, burns, staking, and treasury cash interact.\
It shows whether SAIT stays scarce, whether the treasury runs out, and whether the design is credible.\
\
## Key assumptions in this run\
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 SAIT (fixed, no inflation).\
- **Initial circulation**: 10.0% of supply unlocked in Q1.\
- **Unlock cap**: \uc0\u8804  1.00% per month (\u8776  3.00% per quarter).\
- **Fee per action**: $0.25.\
- **Fee split**: 45% burn, 15% stakers, 40% treasury.\
- **Usage start**: 100,000 actions in Q1, growing 20.0% per quarter.\
- **Staking**: 20% of circulating tokens staked, with 12% APY cap.\
- **Treasury**: start $1,500,000, spending $500,000/quarter.\
- **Burn floor**: 2,000,000 SAIT per quarter, mode=treasury.\
- **Price path**: custom CSV (16 rows).\
\
## How to read the results\
- **Deflationary quarters**: times when burns exceed unlocks (circulating supply shrinks).\
- **Overhang vs Float**: supply waiting to unlock relative to what\'92s circulating (dump risk).\
- **Treasury runway**: quarters before treasury cash runs out.\
- **Crowdfund proceeds**: cash raised from planned sales (tiers).\
\
The following sections show KPI tables, per-scenario reports, and recommendations.\
\
# SAIT Tokenomics \'97 Consolidated Report\
\
## Executive Summary\
- This report compares total-supply scenarios using the same cap-compliant unlock schedule, fee/burn settings, and price path.\
- Burns scale with **usage** rather than supply, so SAIT burned is similar across caps; burn **percent** falls as supply grows.\
- Overhang/Float and Treasury runway are the two most important operational risk flags.\
\
## Inputs & Assumptions\
- Horizon: **16 quarters**\
- Total-supply grid: **1,000,000,000**\
- Initial float: **10.00%** of total (Q1 start)\
- Unlock cap: **1.00%/mo \uc0\u8658  3.00%/qtr** (global)\
- Usage: actions Q1=**100,000**, growth QoQ=**20.0%**\
- Fees: **$0.25/action** | Splits: burn=0.45, stakers=0.15, treasury=0.40\
- Staking: %staked=**20.0%** | target APY=**12.0%** (fee-funded cap)\
- Treasury: start=**$1,500,000**, ops=**$500,000/qtr**\
- Burn floor: **2,000,000 SAIT/q** (treasury)\
- Price: **custom CSV (16 rows)**\
\
## Schedule Diagnostics\
- Total unlock over 16q: **28.00%** of total supply\
- Avg unlock per quarter: **1.75%** | Max per quarter: **3.00%**\
- Global cap breaches: **none** (excess spilled forward if needed)\
\
### Unlocks by Bucket (16q totals)\
- Research: **11.60%**\
- Ecosystem: **8.80%**\
- Team: **2.10%**\
- Partners: **3.00%**\
- Treasury: **1.30%**\
- Liquidity: **1.20%**\
- Total: **28.00%**\
\
## Scenario Comparison (Key KPIs)\
| Total Supply | Init Float | Final Circ | Final Circ % | Cum Burn (SAIT) | Cum Burn % | Defl Qtrs | Runway Q (min) | Peak Unlock %/q | Max Overhang/Float | Avg Staker APY |\
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|\

\
## Recommendations\
- Reduce early unlocks (longer durations, stagger phases) or slightly increase initial float to bring Max Overhang/Float below 40%.\
- Publish the cap-compliant unlock curve and overhang metric alongside governance proposals to set expectations.\
- Add a burn floor (e.g., 2M SAIT/q) financed from treasury early on; remove when usage burns dominate.\

# SAIT Scenario \'97 Total Supply 1,000,000,000\
\
## Headline\
- **Supply**: 16q unlocks = 28.00%; Final circ = 34.80% (347,999,998 SAIT).\
- **Burns**: cumulative = 32,000,000 SAIT (3.20%); Deflationary quarters: 3 (first: Q14).\
- **Treasury**: runway\uc0\u8776  inf q (min balance $3,500,000 at Q1).\
- **Overhang**: max = 60.00%; quarters > 40% = 2.\
\
## Unlocks by Bucket (16q total)\
- Research: 11.60%\
- Ecosystem: 8.80%\
- Team: 2.10%\
- Partners: 3.00%\
- Treasury: 1.30%\
- Liquidity: 1.20%\
- **Total**: 28.00%\
\
## Notes\
- Burns are driven by usage/fees/price, not by total supply \'97 hence identical SAIT burns across caps.\
- Global cap enforcer ensures per-quarter total unlock \uc0\u8804  3% (given 1%/mo cap).\
- Overhang is defined as next-2Q unlocks \'f7 starting float for the quarter.\
\
## Suggested levers if this scenario trips warnings\
- Reduce early unlock pace (longer durations / stagger phases) to cut overhang.\
- Raise burn_share / increase actions / fee_per_action / price to approach deflationary quarters.\
- Consider a small increase in initial float only if liquidity depth is a concern (trade-off: more potential sellers).\

 SAIT Tokenomics \'97 Consolidated Report\
\
## Executive Summary\
- This report compares total-supply scenarios using the same cap-compliant unlock schedule, fee/burn settings, and price path.\
- Burns scale with **usage** rather than supply, so SAIT burned is similar across caps; burn **percent** falls as supply grows.\
- Overhang/Float and Treasury runway are the two most important operational risk flags.\
\
## Inputs & Assumptions\
- Horizon: **16 quarters**\
- Total-supply grid: **500,000,000, 1,000,000,000, 5,000,000,000, 10,000,000,000, 100,000,000,000**\
- Initial float: **10.00%** of total (Q1 start)\
- Unlock cap: **1.00%/mo \uc0\u8658  3.00%/qtr** (global)\
- Usage: actions Q1=**200,000**, growth QoQ=**15.0%**\
- Fees: **$5.00/action** | Splits: burn=0.50, stakers=0.30, treasury=0.20\
- Staking: %staked=**20.0%** | target APY=**3.0%** (fee-funded cap)\
- Treasury: start=**$5,000,000**, ops=**$1,000,000/qtr**\
- Burn floor: **0 SAIT/q** (treasury)\
- Price: **custom CSV (16 rows)**\
\
## Schedule Diagnostics\
- Total unlock over 16q: **44.00%** of total supply\
- Avg unlock per quarter: **2.75%** | Max per quarter: **3.00%**\
- Global cap breaches: **none** (excess spilled forward if needed)\
\
### Unlocks by Bucket (16q totals)\
- Research: **17.06%**\
- Ecosystem: **11.04%**\
- Team: **4.81%**\
- Partners: **5.89%**\
- Treasury: **3.45%**\
- Liquidity: **1.75%**\
- Total: **44.00%**\

\
## Recommendations\
- Increase burn intensity (raise burn_share) and/or adoption (actions growth, fee_per_action) to create at least 1\'962 deflationary quarters by Year 2.\
- Reduce early unlocks (longer durations, stagger phases) or slightly increase initial float to bring Max Overhang/Float below 40%.\
- Publish the cap-compliant unlock curve and overhang metric alongside governance proposals to set expectations.\
- Add a burn floor (e.g., 2M SAIT/q) financed from treasury early on; remove when usage burns dominate.\

## Per-Scenario Details\
\

\
### Scenario \'97 Total Supply 500,000,000\
\
\
## Headline\
- **Supply**: 16q unlocks = 44.00%; Final circ = 27.77% (138,864,608 SAIT).\
- **Burns**: cumulative = 131,135,392 SAIT (26.23%); Deflationary quarters: 0 (first: \'97).\
- **Treasury**: runway\uc0\u8776  7 q (min balance $-1,199,667 at Q12).\
- **Overhang**: max = 50.00%; quarters > 40% = 9.\
\
## Unlocks by Bucket (16q total)\
- Research: 17.06%\
- Ecosystem: 11.04%\
- Team: 4.81%\
- Partners: 5.89%\
- Treasury: 3.45%\
- Liquidity: 1.75%\
- **Total**: 44.00%\
\
## Notes\
- Burns are driven by usage/fees/price, not by total supply \'97 hence identical SAIT burns across caps.\
- Global cap enforcer ensures per-quarter total unlock \uc0\u8804  3% (given 1%/mo cap).\
- Overhang is defined as next-2Q unlocks \'f7 starting float for the quarter.\
\
## Suggested levers if this scenario trips warnings\
- Reduce early unlock pace (longer durations / stagger phases) to cut overhang.\
- Raise burn_share / increase actions / fee_per_action / price to approach deflationary quarters.\
- Consider a small increase in initial float only if liquidity depth is a concern (trade-off: more potential sellers).\
